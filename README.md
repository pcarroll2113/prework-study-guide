# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project's main motivation was to impove my ability to teach myself and learn without instruction. I wanted to create a good base of knowledge to be able to build the rest of my development journey on. I feel that this has provided me an excellent "giant shoulder" to be able to "see even further" on as I continue to learn. This webpage also gives me an excellent baby project that I can return to throughout my coding bootcamp to upgrade and specialize as I learn even more. I hope to improve it and actually utilize it as a study guide and turn it into something of my own that I would truly want to use and return to.

## Usage

The webpage contains notes and command guides for topics like HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. When opened in a browser with the DevTools console the JavaScript can be seen running. Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. In the console panel a list of topics learned in the prework exercises can be found as well as a suggestion on which topic to study first.
