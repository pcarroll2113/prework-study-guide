        <h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
       <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
       <li>HTML elements are case sensitive.</li>
       <li>HTML does not engage in programming "logic" but it is good for displaying and structure.</li>
       <li>HTML is like the frame of a house that provides the structure that the house is built upon.</li>
       <li>All HTML elements are essentially a box.</li>
       <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage; text elements, image elements, header elements, list elements.</li>
       <li>Elements can also be used to divide content on the page and to describe the content to the browsers and other developers; meta-related elements, content division elements, semantic elements.</li>
       <li>HTML elements are composed of a closing and opening tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
     </ul>

   <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      <li>You must link the CSS file to the HTML file to have the styles apply to the application.</li>
      <li>CSS Rules are portrayed as: selector {Property: Value; Property: Value;} (the portion inside the {-} is the declaration block)</li>
      <li>The selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules (or declarations) will apply.</li>
      <li>Declarations contain two components: the CSS <strong>property</strong> we want to apply and the <strong>value</strong> of the property.</li>

     </ul>

   <section class="card" id="git-section">
    <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
       <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
       <li>git commit -m "write commit message here": commits all staged work (It is important to write a brief, clear commit message so you know what each commit is for!)</li>
       <li>git pull: pulls down any changes from your remote</li>
       <li>git push: pushes your local changes up to your remote</li>
       <li>git branch: shows you all your local branches and indicates which branch you are currently on</li>
       <li>git merge name-of-branch: merges the specified branch into the branch you are currently on</li>
       <li>git diff: shows you the changes in your unstaged code</li>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
      <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with websites</li>
      <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language</li>
      <li>One of its core features is variables, which store data types as values</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a Javascript file</li>
      <li>Conditional statements can be used to interrupt control flow</li>
      <li>Variables are containers that store values</li>
      <li>JavaScript is case sensitive</li>
      <li>In JS write a comment as 
        /*
        Everything in between is a comment
        */</li>
      <li>“Commenting out code” makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later</li>
      <li>// This is a comment with no line breaks</li>
      <li>Null is a special value in JavaScript that refers to the absence of a value</li>
      <li>Conceptually, undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object</li>
      <li>NaN ("Not a Number") is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself</li>
      <li>JavaScript strings are immutable-which means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it</li>
      <li>Use strings for textual data. When representing complex data, parse strings, and use the appropriate abstraction</li>
      <li>A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property (In some programming languages, Symbols are called "atoms”)</li>
      <li>The purpose of symbols is to create unique property keys that are guaranteed not to clash with keys from other code</li>
      <li>In JavaScript, objects are the only mutable values</li>
      <li>Functions are also objects with the additional capability of being callable</li>
      <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword</li>
      <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks</li>
      <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon</li>
      <li>A method is a set of instructions that can be carried out by a computer</li>
      <li>An array is a single variable that holds a group of related data</li>
      <li>In JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed and sequential</li>
      <li>A for loop contains three important statements; first: the starting point for the loop, second: the condition, final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item(1. Keyword 'for' 2.three part conditional statement 3.code block)</li>
      <li>Creating a function defines a block of code that performs a specific task and gives it a name</li>
      <li>To execute a function we must call it in our code!</li>
      <li>Since control flow dictates that JavaScript files are executed from top to bottom, order matters</li>
