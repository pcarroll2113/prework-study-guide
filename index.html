        <h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
       <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
       <li>HTML elements are case sensitive.</li>
       <li>HTML does not engage in programming "logic" but it is good for displaying and structure.</li>
       <li>HTML is like the frame of a house that provides the structure that the house is built upon.</li>
       <li>All HTML elements are essentially a box.</li>
       <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage; text elements, image elements, header elements, list elements.</li>
       <li>Elements can also be used to divide content on the page and to describe the content to the browsers and other developers; meta-related elements, content division elements, semantic elements.</li>
       <li>HTML elements are composed of a closing and opening tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
     </ul>

   <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      <li>You must link the CSS file to the HTML file to have the styles apply to the application.</li>
      <li>CSS Rules are portrayed as: selector {Property: Value; Property: Value;} (the portion inside the {-} is the declaration block)</li>
      <li>The selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules (or declarations) will apply.</li>
      <li>Declarations contain two components: the CSS <strong>property</strong> we want to apply and the <strong>value</strong> of the property.</li>

    <h2>Git</h2>

       <li>git commit -m "write commit message here": commits all staged work (It is important to write a brief, clear commit message so you know what each commit is for!)</li>
       <li>git pull: pulls down any changes from your remote</li>
       <li>git push: pushes your local changes up to your remote</li>
       <li>git branch: shows you all your local branches and indicates which branch you are currently on</li>
       <li>git merge name-of-branch: merges the specified branch into the branch you are currently on</li>
